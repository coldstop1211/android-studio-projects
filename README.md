# android-studio-projects
A collection of various apps that I made on android studio

To run: download and unzip files, then open in Android Studio. 

Finacial Calc - a financial calulator that use RPN notation to calulate. Included functions to find interest and other things.

Spinner Project - two spinners that will let you select an album and then songs within it to view information & lyrics of the song

GPS Demo - An app that tracks your location, distance travelled, time spent at location, and your favorite location based on how much time you spend at a place

Weather Project - a Wicked inspired app that lets you input a zipcode and uses OpenWeather to recieve JSON data and display it.
